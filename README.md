## Developing in Hasura

Any time we are making changes to the Hasura backend structure (i.e. the database layer)
we need to run Hasura in Console mode.  This will track all changes in our local file system.

Run the console

```
cd hasura
hasura console
```

A browser window will automatically pop up.  Any changes made in that browser session will be tracked as migration changes in your local file system.

## Applying Hasura Changes

```
cd hasura
hasura migrate apply
```
